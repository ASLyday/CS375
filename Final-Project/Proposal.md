I propose that I will make a simple image viewer that can pan/zoom/rotate around a 3D object. 
I would like the model to be a dog because I think that would be really funny.
I will essentially be following the example schedule given for how I plan on doing my project with:
Week 1 - create the canvas view, and find some models
Week 2 - import models and make sure they're visible under a perspective projection
Week 3 - animate my objects, and improve shading
Week 4 - final polish, presentation prep
