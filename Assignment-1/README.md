I really enjoyed browsing shadertoy.com (https://www.shadertoy.com/). I loved being able to see different examples of what people have done with WebGL and
what I could possibly do as well. It was fun to be able to go into the code and see how some of these shaders worked as well as play around and mess with the different
settings. Being able to change one simple line of code, or just one variable, and see how it affected the shader made me want to play around with it more.
